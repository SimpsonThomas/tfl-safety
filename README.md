# TFL Safety Reporting Web App

Building a tool at the IBM and TfL Hackathon - to help people be safe on London's transport

As the Hackathon is over it is unlikely this app will recieve any more updates in the future and both the Twitter and web app may be taken down at any point. The demo is just a demo so doesn't really have any true functionality.

Check us out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TfLSafety) and you can see a basic version of the web app up [here](https://simpsonthomas.github.io/tfl-safety/) (unfortunately is uses Github pages to host so is occasionally a bit broken)
